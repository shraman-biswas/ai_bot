AI bot
======

Basic AI bot that learns new word pairs and makes inferences from memory to word pair queries.   
Learnt word pairs are stored in a memory file and redundant entries are automatically deleted.  
Memory grows with time and usage. Answers get more detailed as well.

Usage: ./main word1 word2
